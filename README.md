The focus is on implementing serverless machine learning directly in the browser, using TensorFlow.js to run models
without the need for a backend server.

## Feature Engineering

* See [Feature Engineering.md](feature-engineering%2FFeature%20Engineering.md)

## Training

* Deeplearning
* Param Tuning with https://hyperjs.herokuapp.com/
* Add confusion matrix with true positive, true negatives, false positives and false negatives

## Application

* Use cam
* Show label

## Operation

* See [Operation.md](Operation%2FOperation.md)

## Thoughts

* Use it inside Google MediaPipe
* What is it really necessary to balance the features in CNN?
* Not reproducible -> Missing Seed
* Code needs unit tests
